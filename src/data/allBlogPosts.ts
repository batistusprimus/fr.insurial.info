    excerpt: 'As a small or medium business owner in the United States, you juggle countless responsibilities. Learn why adequate insurance coverage is an essential safety net.',
    content: `
      <p>As a small or medium business (SME) owner in the United States, you juggle countless responsibilities, from managing daily operations to planning for future growth. Commercial insurance may seem like another expense to manage, but adequate coverage is an essential safety net that protects your business, employees, and financial future against the unexpected.</p>

      <h2>What is Commercial Insurance and Why is it Essential?</h2>
      <p>Commercial insurance is a contract between a business owner and an insurance company. In exchange for regular premium payments, the insurer agrees to cover the business's financial losses resulting from events specified in the policy.</p>

      <p>The importance of commercial insurance cannot be understated. Without it, a single major claim could destroy an SME. According to FEMA, approximately 40-60% of small businesses never reopen after a disaster.</p>

      <h2>Main Types of Insurance Policies for SMEs</h2>
      
      <h3>General Liability Insurance</h3>
      <p>This is the basic policy most businesses should have. It covers claims for bodily injury, property damage, and personal and advertising injury. In 2025, the average monthly cost is approximately $42.</p>

      <h3>Workers' Compensation Insurance</h3>
      <p>If you have employees, this insurance is almost always mandatory. It covers medical expenses, lost wages, and rehabilitation costs. Average monthly cost in 2025 is approximately $45.</p>

      <h3>Commercial Property Insurance</h3>
      <p>This policy protects your business's physical property against events like fire, theft, or vandalism. Average monthly cost in 2025 is approximately $67.</p>

      <h3>Business Owner's Policy (BOP)</h3>
      <p>A BOP combines general liability and commercial property insurance into a single policy, often at a lower cost. Average monthly cost is approximately $57.</p>

      <h2>The 2025 Commercial Insurance Landscape</h2>
      <p>The market in 2025 is shaped by social inflation, cyber risks, climate change, and supply chain disruptions.</p>

        <li>Consider inflation and business growth</li>
        <li>Don't just focus on premium costs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Not Reading Your Policy</h2>
      <p>Understanding your coverage is crucial:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review policy exclusions</li>
        <li>Understand coverage triggers</li>
        <li>Know your deductibles and limits</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Cyber risks often require separate coverage</li>
        <li>Flood damage typically excluded</li>
        <li>Professional services may need E&O insurance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other Critical Mistakes</h2>

        <li>Not working with experienced agents</li>
        <li>Failing to document assets properly</li>
        <li>Ignoring risk management</li>
